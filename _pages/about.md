I am a 25 years old student of the Master 2 Program in Economics Theory and Econometrics (M2 ETE) at the TSE.<br>
The M2 ETE program is considered to be the 1st year of the PhD program at the TSE.<br>
In addition to that, I have graduated with a MSc in Economics and Finance from the BSE and a BSc in Economics from AUEB.<br>
Until August 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant in the **Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP)**.<br>
I am fascinated by the field of economics and in particular by the field of macroeconomics. <br>
I have a keen interest in understanding economic theories and concepts and using them along with data in order to propose policies and conduct analysis that will have a positive impact into society.

My academic interests include:<br>
**Primary:** Macroeconomics, Monetary Economics, Time Series Econometrics<br>
**Secondary:** Development Economics, Labor Economics, Political Economy, Finance <br>
