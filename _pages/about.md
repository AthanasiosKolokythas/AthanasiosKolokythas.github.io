About me:
======
I am a 23 years old postgraduate degree student in the Master Degree Program in Economics of the BSE.

Currently, besides the pursuit of my master's degree, I work as a research economist in the Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP) until August 2024.

I am fascinated by the field of economics. 
I have a keen interest in understanding economic theories and concepts and using them along with data in order to propose policies and conduct analysis.

My academic interests include:

Primary: Macroeconomics, Monetary Economics, Time Series

Secondary: Economic growth, Labor Economics
