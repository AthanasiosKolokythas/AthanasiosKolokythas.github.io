I am a 24 years old postgraduate degree student in the Master Degree Program in Economics of the BSE.

Currently, besides the pursuit of my master's degree, I work as a Research Economist in the **Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP)** until August 2024.

I am fascinated by the field of economics. 
I have a keen interest in understanding economic theories and concepts and using them along with data in order to propose policies and conduct analysis that will have a positive impact into society.

My academic interests include:

Primary: Macroeconomics, Monetary Economics, Time Series Econometrics

Secondary: Economic growth, Labor Economics
