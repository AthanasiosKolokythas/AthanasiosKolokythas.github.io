I am a 24 years old postgraduate degree student in the Master Degree Program in Economics of the BSE.

Until August 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant in the **Hellenic Foundation for European & Foreign Policy (ELIAMEP)**.

I am fascinated by the field of economics. 
I have a keen interest in understanding economic theories and concepts and using them along with data in order to propose policies and conduct analysis that will have a positive impact into society.

My academic interests include:

Primary: Macroeconomics, Monetary Economics, Time Series Econometrics

Secondary: Development Economics, Labor Economics, Political Economy
